The little bear, the little mouse, and the little monkey watch as the moon climbs higher.
The little bear, the little mouse, and the little monkey see the stars twinkle around the moon.
The little bear, the little mouse, and the little monkey dance under the moonlight.
The little bear, the little mouse, and the little monkey lay down, gazing at the moon back in place.
The little bear, the little mouse, and the little monkey fall asleep, dreaming under the night sky.
