A kind farmer notices the puppy in distress.
The farmer gently frees the puppy from the grapevines.
The farmer gives the puppy a bowl of water to soothe its throat.
The puppy wags its tail, gratefully licking the farmer's hand.
The puppy plays with a juicy grape on the ground, now careful not to swallow it.
